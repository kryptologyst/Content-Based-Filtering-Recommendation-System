# Project 322. Content-based filtering
# Description:
# Content-based filtering recommends items based on the features of the items and a user’s past preferences. The system computes a similarity score between the features of items and the user’s profile, which is created from items they have liked in the past.

# We’ll implement a simple content-based filtering system using TF-IDF for text-based features (e.g., movie descriptions, product features).

# 🧪 Python Implementation (Content-Based Filtering with TF-IDF):
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
 
# 1. Simulate item features (movie descriptions)
items = ['Movie1', 'Movie2', 'Movie3', 'Movie4', 'Movie5']
descriptions = [
    "Action movie with thrilling sequences",
    "Romantic comedy with funny moments",
    "Action-packed superhero movie",
    "Drama about love and loss",
    "A romantic comedy with unexpected twists"
]
df = pd.DataFrame({'Item': items, 'Description': descriptions})
 
# 2. TF-IDF vectorization of item descriptions
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Description'])
 
# 3. Compute cosine similarity between items
cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)
 
# 4. Recommend items for a given item (e.g., Movie1)
item_idx = 0  # Movie1
similarities = cosine_sim[item_idx]
recommendations = list(enumerate(similarities))
 
# Sort recommendations based on similarity score
recommendations = sorted(recommendations, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
 
# 5. Print recommended items for Movie1
print("Recommendations for Movie1:")
for idx, score in recommendations[1:]:
    print(f"{df['Item'][idx]}: {score:.2f}")


# ✅ What It Does:
# Simulates movie descriptions as features

# Uses TF-IDF to convert descriptions into vectors

# Computes cosine similarity between item features

# Recommends movies similar to Movie1 based on textual features
